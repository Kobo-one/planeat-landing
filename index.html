            <h3>Reward your children</h3>
            <p>Furthermore, there is good coordination between you as a parent and your child (ren). As a parent you are always in control, but the children are actively involved. They have a say in this by choosing daily from the menus chosen by you.</p>
            <p class="feature__item--hidden">Reward your children when they choose a meal. In this way they opt for a meal that is healthy. When they have collected enough points, they can use them to choose an unhealthy menu. The children therefore have a say and they strive for healthy eating. A real win-win situation.</p>
